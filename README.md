Solar panel placement tool

Our project is a tool for designing solar arrays on urban rooftops. It allows landlords, neighborhood councils and other individuals or groups to map a site, and then use a software model to create an optimum array design based on energy production, cost and area. The design tool improves on solar array design techniques in dense urban areas, as well as increases the ease of adoption of alternative energy systems.
